## 👨‍🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to kickstart your journey with **AgentX** is by utilizing the bundled CLI for an automatic setup. This CLI takes care of a range of essential setup tasks for **AgentX**, including configuring crucial:
- 🔐 [Environment variables](https://github.com/OpenAgentX/AgentX/blob/main/.env.example) (and API Keys)
- 📖 [Documentation  🚧]() 

## Prerequisites 👆

Before diving headfirst into the world of **AgentX**, here's a checklist of prerequisites to ensure a smooth embarkation:

- Your favorite code editor; for instance, [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) - The language that empowers all to create robust and efficient software.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). After installation, create a Docker account, launch the Docker application, and sign in.
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- A [Serper API Key](https://serper.dev/signup) (optional)

## Getting Started 🎊:
1. **Open your preferred code editor**

2. **Fire up the Terminal** - Typically, this can be achieved through a 'Terminal' tab or by employing a keyboard shortcut
   (e.g., `Ctrl + ~` for Windows or `Control + ~` for Mac in VS Code).

3. **Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Directory** - Once your terminal is live, clone the repository and dive into the project directory using the following commands.

   **For Mac/Linux/Windows users** :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenAgentX/AgentX.git
   cd AgentX
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-openapi-key'
   cargo run -- -i "your task description"    
   ```

    **For example, you can execute the following command:**
    ```bash
    cargo run -- -i "Creating a snake game using python"  
    ```
4. **Adhere to the Setup Instructions Provided by the Script** - 

Prepare to dive into the realm of limitless possibilities! :tada:

## 💡 Use Open-Source Models as Backends 🚧
Using an open-sourced model as the backend is based on an external server running LLM inference service.
